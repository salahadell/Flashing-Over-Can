## Flashing-Over-Can
The aim of this project is to develop a robust system that enables the flashing of code between two STM32 microcontrollers using the CAN communication protocol.

This system comprises two key components: the Receiver and the Transceiver, each serving a
specific role in achieving the desired functionality.
## Supported features
1) Flash up to 2 applications [The old one and the updated one]
2) Switch between them so if there is a problem with one of them you can switch to the other version
3) The bootloader accepts data only from specific IDs
## Features will be Supported 
1) Secure the applications before sending them over the CAN to acheive confidentiality, integrity and authenticity. This feature will support feature number (3) to prevent phishing attacks
