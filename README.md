## Flashing-Over-Can
The aim of this project is to develop a robust system that enables the flashing of code between two STM32 microcontrollers using the CAN communication protocol.

This system comprises two key components: the Receiver and the Transceiver, each serving a
specific role in achieving the desired functionality.
